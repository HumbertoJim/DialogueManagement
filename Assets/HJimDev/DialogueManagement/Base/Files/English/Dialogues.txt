I've been looking for an excuse to talk to you for a while, heh, but I was too shy. ?;? How can I do it if you're so serious? You take seriousness very seriously. ?;?  ?;? Player: ?;? Yes, I don't usually go around seeking attention. ?;?  ?;? Danna: ?;? Hehe, you're an example to follow. ?;? I must say you are for me too because you're very responsible, and that really catches my attention. ?;? In my case, it's usually the opposite, studying is so boring for me. ?;? Tell me a way to stop being like this! ?;? It's hard. ?;?  ?;? Player: ?;? You don't have to be so hard on yourself, you just have to make an effort, I know you can do it. ?;?  ?;? Danna: ?;? Really?

I've been watching you lately. ?;? D...don't think anything weird. ?;? But I think I've started to admire you because your serious and calm gaze in every situation somehow motivates me. ?;? It's like I want to try to improve and stop worrying so much. ?;? It's something very strange and confusing for me because lately, I've been really interested in getting to know you. ?;? And... ?;?

But don't laugh! ?;?  ?;? Player: ?;? ... ?;?  ?;? Danna: ?;? At least say something! The truth is, I've been thinking all this time about how I could approach you. ?;?  ?;? Player: ?;? It's okay. ?;?  ?;? Danna: ?;? What? Tell me something! ?;?  ?;? Player: ?;? To get to know each other. ?;?  ?;? Danna: ?;? Whaaat!? ?;? Yes! ?;? Thank you! ?;? In that case... I'll make an effort to get closer to you. ?;?  ?;? Player: ?;? Thank you very much. ?;?  ?;? Danna: ?;? I think the teacher is coming... ?;?
